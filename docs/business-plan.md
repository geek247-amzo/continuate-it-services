# Business Plan for Continuate IT Services

## Executive Summary
Continuate IT Services is a Johannesburg-based Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) specializing in comprehensive IT management, with integrated Network Operations Center (NOC) and Security Operations Center (SOC) capabilities. Leveraging Atera's MSP platform as the core tool for remote monitoring and management (RMM), the company starts with one technician supporting unlimited devices. The business aims to provide reliable, proactive IT support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa, focusing on a competitive fixed-rate pricing model to simplify budgeting for clients.

Key services include base managed IT support, with add-ons for cybersecurity and backup, plus project-based offerings like networking, CCTV, biometrics, server rooms, and hardware installations. The South African IT services market is projected to grow from approximately USD 14.73 billion in 2025 to USD 26.99 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 12.87%, driven by cloud adoption, cybersecurity needs, and digital transformation. The managed services segment alone is expected to expand significantly, with revenues potentially reaching USD 18.35 billion by 2033 at a 10.8% CAGR.

With initial costs centered around Atera's Professional plan at approximately R3,200 per month (based on £139 GBP annual billing, converted at current rates), Continuate targets 20-30 SME clients in the first year to achieve profitability. Revenue projections estimate R1.2 million in Year 1, scaling to R3.5 million by Year 3 through client acquisition and upselling add-ons. This plan positions Continuate as a cost-effective, local alternative to larger competitors like Turrito Networks, Net at Work, and Dimension Data.

## Market Analysis
### Industry Overview
The South African IT services market is robust and growing rapidly, fueled by broadband expansion under SA Connect, hyperscale cloud investments from providers like AWS and Microsoft, and increasing cyber threats. Managed services, including MSSP offerings, are a key growth area, with the segment valued at around USD 8.16 billion in 2025 and projected to reach USD 18.35 billion by 2033 at a 10.8% CAGR. Cybersecurity and cloud services dominate, with managed security posting a 14.2% CAGR through 2030.

In the broader African context, the Middle East and Africa (MEA) managed services market is worth USD 10.7 billion, with South Africa leading alongside UAE and Saudi Arabia. SMEs, which form 91% of South African businesses, increasingly outsource IT due to talent shortages and load-shedding challenges, creating opportunities for MSSPs.

### Target Market
- **Primary Customers:** SMEs with 5-100 employees in Johannesburg and surrounding areas, in industries like retail, finance, healthcare, and manufacturing.
- **Market Size:** Johannesburg hosts a concentration of businesses needing cybersecurity, with the local managed services demand driven by cyber-risks and digital transformation.

  - **Tier 2 (11-50 users):** R10,000/month fixed (effective R200/user).
